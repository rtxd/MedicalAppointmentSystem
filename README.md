# UTS Medical System Prototype

## Current System
UTS provides students, staff, alumni and their families access to a health service. Currently, students can only make appointments by calling reception, where the receptionist will manually check for availabilities and coordinate with the student to find a suitable time. Once a time has been agreed upon, the receptionist with manually enter the appointment details into the existing system, removing that specific availability. The doctors can then check for incoming appointments and prepare accordingly before the student arrives for their appointment.


## Proposed Solution
We intend to develop an online web-based system that allows UTS students to schedule an appointment with a doctor at the UTS medical centre via a website. The student will log into the website using their UTS login credentials. They will be able to create, manage and delete their appointments through the system. The system maintain some existing process such as allowing the doctors to view their schedules including upcoming appointments and allow the receptionists to keep track of the doctors schedules and make new appointments/schedule follow-ups in person and over the phone on behalf of the student. 


## Project Objectives
Streamline the medical staff appointment booking process for all users (students, receptionist and doctors).
Allow patients to view available appointments and make appointments via a web interface.
Allow usage of booking system from any location (must have internet connection) that is most convenient to the student.
